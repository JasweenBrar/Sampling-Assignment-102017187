🌸 **Sub-Group: 3CS8**

## 💠 What's in this assignment ?
* Solution of Sampling Assignment of Course UCS654.
* Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection
* Used various techniques to balance dataset. 
* Applied different sampling techniques on different ML models.
* Find out which combination of sampling and model has highest accuracy

## 💠 TASKS Performed:

### ⭐ TASK-1 -> Download dataset and convert it into balanced dataset

  *The dataset is highly imbalanced as it contains 763 rows of Class 0 and only 9 rows of Class 1*
  
  *So,I used SMOTE oversampling to balance the dataset*
 
### ⭐ TASK-2 -> Create 5 samples (Using sample size detection formula) & Using 5 Different sampling techniques
  **Techniques Used**

    *Sampling 1 = Simple Random Sampling*

    *Sampling 2 = Stratified Sampling*

    *Sampling 3 = Cluster Sampling*

    *Sampling 4 = Systematic Sampling*

    *Sampling 5 = Multi-Stage Sampling*

### ⭐ TASK-3 -> Train all 5 samples using 5 different ML Models
  **Models Used**

    *M1 = Decision Tree*

    *M2 = Logistic Regression*

    *M3 = Gaussian Naive Bayes*

    *M4 = Gradient Boosting Classifier*

    *M5 = Random Forest Classifier*

### ⭐ TASK-4 -> Observe: Which sampling technique gives highest accuracy on which model?
  **Output Table**
